# Food Ordering Website - Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB

This project is aimed at building a full-fledged food ordering website using the Angular framework for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The website will allow users to browse through various food items, place orders, and make payments online. The project is currently in Stage 1, focusing on the frontend development using Angular. Subsequent stages will involve the implementation of the backend using Node.js and integrating it with MongoDB.

## Stage 1: Frontend (Angular)

In this stage, we will be developing the frontend of the food ordering website using the Angular framework. Angular is a powerful and popular front-end development platform that allows us to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the setup, ensure that you have the following tools and technologies installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)

### Setting up the Frontend

Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend of the website:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the Angular development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

5. Open your web browser and access the website at `http://localhost:4200/`.

### Features

At this stage, the frontend will include the following features:

- User authentication and registration.
- Displaying a list of available restaurants and their respective menus.
- Allowing users to add items to their cart and adjust quantities.
- Calculating the total price of the order.
- Proceeding to the checkout page.

## Stage 2: Backend (Node.js) and Database (MongoDB)

The next stage of the project will focus on building the backend using Node.js and setting up the MongoDB database. The backend will handle user authentication, process orders, manage restaurant data, and interact with the database for data storage.

## Future Development

In the subsequent stages, we will work on the following features:

- Implementing user authentication and authorization on the backend.
- Building RESTful APIs for handling user registration, login, and order processing.
- Integrating the backend with MongoDB for data storage.
- Adding admin functionalities to manage restaurants and their menus.
- Implementing real-time order tracking and notifications.

Please note that this Readme will be updated as the project progresses through different stages.
